Log:
- start a nginx server that uses index.html on vm
- created a dns server with dnsmasq that maps facebook to the vms ip
- set resolve.conf file dns to my vm
- try dig facebook.com and it works correctly
- try curl and it is still going to the real facebook
- check with tcpdump and it is indeed still goin g over the real dns
- find out about /etc/nsswitch.conf which sets the order of lookup
- specifically dns which uses resolv.conf was the last in line which meant every other method was being used before
- resolved which uses the systemd-resolved service was being used and the reason why curl and normal get request
were failing
- so I set the ip of dns in systemd resolved by doing resolved interface (wlp1s0 in this case) ip (of the vm)
- curl was now working but not get requests in firefox using http
- apparently firefox switches automatically from http to https for known pages like facebook
- lets try to setup a https instead with caddy 
- its not possible because there needs to be a dns entry

-------DHCP STARVATION--------------------
- found this tool called yersinia
- only GUI version has dhcp attacks so I will try on the host
- yersinia seems to have a bug with the GUI so I will try running it locally
